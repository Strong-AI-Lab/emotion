# Papers

This directory contains scripts used to run experiments for papers that
we've published. Each subdirectory corresponds to a publicaiton and has
a README with a description of the paper and how to run the experiments.
Each publication will also be associated with a git tag and a GitHub
release on the
[releases](https://github.com/Strong-AI-Lab/emotion/releases) page.

**NOTE**: Scripts in subdirectories will probably not be updated much
after publication. Please checkout the appropriate git tag to use these
scripts.
